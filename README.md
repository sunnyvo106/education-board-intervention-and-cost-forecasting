📌 Business Understanding
Background

Fort Vermilion School Division (FVSD) is a public education organization responsible for managing multiple schools across academic years and semesters. To support data-driven planning, FVSD collects standardized assessment data to evaluate student performance and determine the level of academic support required.

Each academic year is divided into three semesters: Fall, Winter, and Spring. During each semester, students complete multiple standardized assessments that generate performance scores and associated testing costs. These assessment results are used not only to monitor educational outcomes but also to inform staffing and budget decisions.

Stakeholders

School Board Members: Monitor overall student performance and educational quality

Finance & Operations Managers: Plan teacher allocation and manage testing and intervention costs

Business Objectives

Analyze student assessment performance across schools, semesters, and academic years

Identify students requiring additional academic intervention

Estimate the number of teachers needed for intervention programs

Forecast testing and intervention-related costs for upcoming semesters

Support proactive resource allocation and long-term planning

Assessment & Intervention Logic

Students are evaluated using standardized assessments each semester

Assessment results are classified into performance levels and grouped into broader categories

Students requiring additional support are assigned to intervention tiers based on their scores

Intervention Rules

Scores between 80 and 90 → Tier 2 intervention

Scores below 80 → Tier 3 intervention

Tier 2: 10 students per teacher

Tier 3: 5 students per teacher

Analytical Approach

Assessment results are analyzed at the student and semester level

Historical performance data is used to project future intervention needs

Teacher and cost forecasts for a semester are estimated using results from the previous semester

Performance trends are evaluated across time to support strategic decision-making

Key Questions Addressed

How are students distributed across assessment performance levels?

What proportion of students fall below expected performance benchmarks?

How many teachers are required for Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention groups?

What are the projected testing and intervention costs for upcoming semesters?

How is student performance changing over time?
